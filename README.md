# Vinbot
This respository is my project to play with Raspberry Pi, few sensors and AI to create some interesting things

# Overview
TBD

# High level user stories
- Basic hardware integration
  --- As a user, I want to control 4 DC motors using my Raspberry Pi to create a rover
- As a user, I want the rover to detect objects using ultrasonic sensor, so that the rover can stop and avoid hitting the object
- As a user, I want the rover to take corrective actions after detecting an object, so that the rover can navigate a new path without obstacles... This will be one step towards autonomous driving
- As a user, I want the rover to be able to take in feed from the pi-camera and share it over the internet so that I can see exactly what the rover camera sees
- As a user, I want a machine learning (ML) algorithm which can injest the picamera images so that it can process it to identify objects in its path... Object classification
- As a user, I want ML to output
